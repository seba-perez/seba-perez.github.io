		  <em>The new study, led by Anuroop Dasgupta, a doctoral researcher at ESO, YEMS and at the Diego Portales University in Chile, follows up observations of V960 Mon made a couple of years ago. Those observations, made with both SPHERE and the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), revealed that the material orbiting V960 Mon is shaped into a series of intricate spiral arms. They also showed that the material is fragmenting, in a process known as ‘gravitational instability’, when large clumps of the material around a star contract and collapse, each with the potential to form a planet or a larger object.</em>

		  Since ALMA captured the striking image of HL Tau in 2014—revealing intricate rings and gaps in the disk surrounding a newborn star—astronomers have been trying to understand how such complex structures could form so early.
		  Now, combining observations from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) with advanced simulations, a research team led by Santiago Orcajo from the Instituto de Astrofísica de La Plata (CONICET and Universidad Nacional de La Plata, Argentina), in collaboration with researchers from the YEMS Millennium Nucleus in Chile—including myself—has developed a new model that traces the evolution of these disks through five distinct stages. The results strongly support a planet-driven origin for these substructures and provide fresh insight into how forming planets interact with their natal disks.

		<h3><strong>Discovery of molecular outflow and possible inflow in the FU Orionis system</strong></h3>

		  Extract from the press release: “FU Ori has been devouring material for almost 90 years to keep its eruption going. We have finally found an answer to how these young outbursting stars replenish their mass,” explains Antonio Hales, lead author of this research, published today in the Astrophysical Journal, “For the first time we have direct observational evidence of the material fueling the eruptions.” ALMA observations revealed a long, thin stream of carbon monoxide falling onto FU Orionis. This gas didn't appear to have enough fuel to sustain the current outburst. Instead, this accretion streamer is believed to be a leftover from a previous, much larger feature that fell into this young stellar system. “The range of angular scales we are able to explore with a single instrument is truly remarkable. ALMA gives us a comprehensive view of the dynamics of star and planet formation, spanning from large molecular clouds in which hundreds of stars are born, down to the more familiar scales of solar systems,” adds Sebastián Pérez of Universidad de Santiago de Chile (USACH), director of the Millennium Nucleus on Young Exoplanets and their Moons (YEMS) in Chile, and co-author of this research.</p>

Using ESO’s Very Large Telescope (VLT) and the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), researchers have detected large dusty clumps, close to a young star, that could collapse to create giant planets. "Our group has been searching for signs of how planets form for over ten years, and we couldn't be more thrilled about this incredible discovery," says Sebastián Pérez from the University of Santiago, Chile.</p>

Our high-resolution observations revealed intricate patterns of ridges and trenches within this dust ring, and a very strong "kink" in the gas movement that suggest the presence of some kind of local perturbation. These kinks or wiggles in the velocity field hint at complex interactions in the disk, possibly involving vertical gas flows or additional hidden objects. Our findings help us understand how planets might form and shape their surroundings.</p>

		<p>The migration of planetary cores embedded in a protoplanetary disk is an important mechanism within planet-formation theory, relevant for the architecture of planetary systems. Consequently, planet migration is actively discussed, yet often results of independent theoretical or numerical studies are unconstrained due to the lack of observational diagnostics designed in light of planet migration. In this work we follow the idea of inferring the migration behavior of embedded planets by means of the characteristic radial structures that they imprint in the disk’s dust density distribution. </p>

		<p><span class="image fit"><a href="images/research/1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="images/research/1.jpg" alt="" /></a></span>ALMA has seen a plethora of rings and gaps in almost all protoplanetary disks it has observed at high resolution, yet the origins of these structures remain a matter of intense debate. As the quality of the observations increases, the ringed structures grow in number and complexity, challenging a simple interpretation based on planetary origins. The new ALMA observations of HD169142, a protoplanetary disk 370 light-years away in the constellation of Sagittarius, allowed <strong>a team led by Sebastian Perez</strong>, from University of Santiago (Chile) to explain the seemingly complex architecture of protoplanetary ring systems with the presence of a single <em>migrating</em> low-mass planet.</p>

		<p><span class="image fit"><a href="images/research/4.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="images/research/4.jpg" alt="" /></a></span>To better understand how giant planets form, we need solid evidence of their presence in the gas-rich discs around young stars. Following up on our 2015 kinematic predictions, we explore how planets interacting with these discs create distinct patterns in the movement of gas and proposed that these are best detected in residual moment maps, which we can observe using specific molecular emissions. By running 3D simulations, we found that giant planets leave strong kinematic signatures, such as changes in gas rotation and flows, which can be detected with high-resolution instruments like the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. These signatures allow us to indirectly spot planets and could eventually help us estimate their mass.</p>

This method, now known as "disk kinematics," has emerged as one of the most promising approaches for identifying planets in formation and gaining insights into the dynamics of planet formation. The effectiveness of this method has been validated through the detection of several forming planets in nearby protoplanetary disks, marking a significant advancement in our understanding of how planets develop within these environments.</p>

		<p>A piece in the puzzle of how planets form has been unlocked thanks to new insight on planet forming systems. Planets are thought to form in disks of gas and dust that surround new born stars. Assuming that these protoplanetary disks lie in a single plane, all proto-planets tend to be contained in that plane too, much like the planets in our Solar System revolve in coplanar orbits. In Marino et al. (2015), we demonstrated for the first time that disks are not necessarily flat and that the presence of shadows in a planet forming system requires at least two tilted disks: an inner disk practically perpendicular to its outer regions.</p>
